            <h2>Ancient Capital of the Erranite Empire</h2>
            
            <p>
                Gravity-defying Bluestone spires sprout from the dense forest like hands reaching up to the heavens, each of the many "fingers" intricately carved with the runic language of their creators. But there is no one left to read them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vilras was the largest and oldest city of the Ancient Erranite Empire. At the empire's peak, just before the fall, it was home to the worlds largest repositories of arcane knowledge and power. It is this power that has protected the stones of the city itself from crumbling to rubble in the subsequent centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thought to be the originating point of Silverblight, Vilras is unsurprisingly located in the least hospitable region of the Blightwood. Seldom do mortals venture so far; what little we know of the city is drawn from stories and legends of Blessed Adventurers long departed.
