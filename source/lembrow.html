
<h1>Lembrow</h1>
<h2>Hardy Town in the Shadow of the Blightwood</h2>

<p>
Nestled in the Valley of Lem, where the woodland gives way to grassland, near the confluence of the rivers Lem and Telling, we find the fortified town of Lembrow. A high stone wall with five stone turrets is a lot for a town of this size, but this close to the Blightwood, you can never be too secure.
</p>

<p>
Where other towns might have small houses or farmsteads scattering the fields that surround the town centre, or even nestled up against the outer walls, Lembrow has nothing. Though the occasional crumbling ruin of a barn or farmhouse in the outskirts of the town is a reminder that this was not always the case.

<p>
At dawn every day bells ring out from the South tower, which marks the beginning of another day for the townsfolk of Lembrow; another day survived on the border of the Blightwood. The guards open the gates, the blacksmith lights his forge, and of blue-robed figures emerge from a large stone building - the Sanitorium - and begin walking the streets, collecting tithes for the Church.
