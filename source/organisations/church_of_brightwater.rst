The Church of Brightwater
=========================

    "Let the darkness know: we are the Light that does not yield."
    
    --- Mother Superior Agnessa Kandalah Yovahl

In the eyes of many, the Church of Brightwater was and continues to be the single most important organisation in the fight against the Silverblight. In their Sanatoria they administer life-saving treatment to those afflicted, and in their Refineries they produce the priceless Reversing Elixir, the one substance capable of undoing the Silverblight's infection In settlements across Erran they work closely with Blessed Defenders, supporting each other to deliver their services more effectively.

The endurance of the Church's relationship with the Blessed Defenders is seen through their worship of the Blessed Saints. These are Blessed Defenders of years gone by who gave their lives in heroic acts of defence against the Blight, immortalised in prayers and hymns heard in the Church's ceremonies across Erran.

The Church does not follow a higher power per se, but a lot their teachings make reference to a nebulous concept known has "the Light". This is not a deity in the conventional sense; rather it is a personification of the hope that the people of Erran will overcome the Blight, and the knowledge that might make it possible.

Locations
---------
Lightwarden Abbey serves as the headquarters of the church, located in the Church's founding city: Brightwater. The Abbey overlooks the city from atop St. Septa's Island in Lake Vossar.

Sanatoria:

* Brightwater: "Grand Sanatorium of the Light Everlasting" - Mothers Enid Coren and Rosalind Hornfarr.
* Lembrow - Blessed Mother Mariah Fairford
* Mullick - Blessed Mother Brinna Wellsworth
* Millhold - Mother Irene Oberrak
* *Others...*

Refineries:

Hierarchy
---------
The acolytes of the Church who operate the Sanatoria and Refineries, generally referred to as "Sisters", may have different ranks among them based on seniority and competence. They can broadly be divided into three categories:

* **Sisters Attendant** are generally the lowest rank of acolytes of the Church. They receive training in basic medicine and work in Sanatoria, attempting to slow the progression of Silverblight in the patients, and eventually collecting blightstones from the deceased to be passed on to the Sisters Alchemical.
* The **Sisters Alchemical** are more experienced acolytes who have studied the arcane techniques for producing Reversing Elixir, and do so in specialised Refineries. They may spend many years studying, and often spend some time at the Library of Lightwarden Abbey to do so.
* Lastly, **Sisters Itinerant** work between Sanatoria and Refineries, responsible for securely and effectively transporting the blightstones and elixir to where they are needed most. Outside of this, they also perform evangelical duties and collect the much needed tithes that enable the Church to operate.

Irrespective of their role, they all answer to the establishment's **Mother Overseer**. Some of the Church's larger establishments may even have multiple Mothers Overseer in command.

Lightwarden Abbey hosts an additional Mother Overseer to whom the other Mothers Overseer report; she is named **Mother Superior**, and is the head of the Church. The incumbent is 89-year-old Agnessa Kandalah Yovahl. Responsibilities of the role include:

* Administration of Lightwarden Abbey and liaison with the Mayor of Brightwater.
* Hosting the annual Church Congress, where the Mothers Overseer from across Erran gather to take stock of the year past and discuss the plans for the year ahead.
* Managing the establishment of additional Refineries or Sanatoria.

When a Mother assumes her role, one of her first duties is the nomination of her successor from among the other sisters at her institution, or in the case of Mother Superior, from among the other Mothers Overseer of the Church. However, these nominations are kept secret, not revealed until the death or resignation of the post's occupant, and is free to be changed at any time.

Mothers that resign from their duties, generally due to age or illness, are known as **Mothers Ethereal**, and are granted permanent residence at the institution they served, should they want it.

The Blessed Saints
------------------

Ordered alphabetically, here is a list of the Blessed Saints whose worship is currently observed by the Church of Brightwater:

* St. Agnessa, Keeper of the Well
* St. Brinna, Shield of Courage
* St. Cyril, the Wise
* St. Eligius, the Watchman
* St. Jory, the Clarion
* St. Mariah, the Lightbringer
* St. Septa, Mother of the Church
* St. Yva, of the Waves
* *Patron of Sanatoria?*
* *Each class and/or cleric domain needs a patron?*

St. Agnessa, Keeper of the Well
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Patron of Wells, Soldiers, and various towns in the Grimpeaks. When a blighted horde descended on the area, they threatened to infect the water supply, risking the infection of a much larger area. Gathering other Blessed Defenders from the surrounding villages, Agnessa lead a last stand to defend the wellspring. Though the defence was ultimately successful, she was slain in battle against a fearsome Blight-troll.

St. Brinna, Shield of Courage
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Patron of Shields, Accidents, and Refineries. During the demonstration of a new prototype of refining equipment, a fault caused a tank to rupture. This would have lead to the mixture of highly volatile solvents and an violent explosion of acid that would have melted the observers and anyone who happened to be walking in the street nearby... were it not for the quick actions of Brinna, who used herself as a shield to seal the breach. This gave enough time for the area to be vacated and the tank emptied safely. But her exposure to the solvents had done significant damage, and she succumbed to her injuries shortly after.

St. Cyril, the Wise
"""""""""""""""""""
Patron of Scholarship, Writing, and Port Rallian. Originally a student of Old Imperial Languages at the University of Port Rallian, the translation of the Vilras Manuscript was a call-to-arms for young Cyril. He subsequently lead many expeditions deep into the Blightwood to uncover more information about Reversing Elixir from Old Imperial ruins, and used the knowledge he uncovered to make key contributions to the Church's development of the refining process. He presumably met his end on a final expedition to Vilras from which he never returned, seeking the other half of Mariah's manuscript, 

St. Eligius, the Watchman
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
Patron of Watchmen, Night, and the Valley of Lem. Eligius was head of the guard at the Old Watchtower in the Valley of Lem. Responsible for warning the towns in the valley of bands of blighted creatures advancing over the Grimpeaks, Eligius was on watch on the fateful night that "a thousand eyes looked up from the trees". The tower --- and soon the whole valley --- was quickly overrun by blighted forest creatures of every sort, but not before Eligius could light the beacon one final time.

St. Jory, the Clarion
"""""""""""""""""""""
Patron of Music, Songs, and [location]. When Jory and his fellow townsfolk woke to find their [town/city] now also home to several giant bears that had been blinded by the blight, they locked themselves in their houses. But realising that the bears could only hunt them by sound, Jory walked the streets ringing bells and singing the hymns of the Church to draw the entire pack to his location and lead them out of the [town/city]. While he did succeed in getting the bears out of the town, he himself could not escape them forever, and thus met a grisly end.

St. Mariah, the Lightbringer
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Patron of Adventure, Magic, and Ancient Relics. Mariah was a Blessed Relic-seeker from Lembrow, and arguably the most prolific of all time. But of all the ancient, magical, and mysterious artefacts she recovered from the ruins of the Erranite Empire, one stands above the rest in its significance. The Vilras Manuscript (as it is now known) --- an unassuming scrap of crumbling parchment taken from a sealed chamber high in a spire of the Ancient Imperial capital --- on translation suggested the existence of means of permanently reversing the effects of Silverblight, and even hinted at how to make it. She brought it to Brightwater, which would spark the decades of experiments and research that led to the creation of the first vial of Reversing Elixir.

However, the manuscript was incomplete. While the experiments in Brightwater continued, she and the Blessed Adventurer Cyril set out on a second expedition to Vilras to recover the rest of the manuscript. They were never seen again.

St. Septa, Mother of the Church
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Patron of Buildings, Islands, and Brightwater. During the latter part of the Years of Darkness, St. Septa came to the city of Brightwater and founded the Church, becoming the first Mother Superior. Her full title is thus Blessed Mother Superior Saint Septa Iridessa Morhaim. She is one of few figures from the Years of Darkness whose existence is well-documented. While she did not meet an untimely end in battle against some blighted foe, or in sacrifice for the lives of others, she has been remembered never the less for her foundational teachings that make up the ideology of the Church today.

St. Yva, of the Waves
"""""""""""""""""""""
Patron of Ships, Sailors, and ???. Something goes wrong at sea?
