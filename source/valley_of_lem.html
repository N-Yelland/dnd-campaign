            <h1>Lembrow</h1>
            <h2>Hardy Town in the Shadow of the Blightwood</h2>

            <p>
            Nestled in the Valley of Lem, where the woodland gives way to grassland, near the confluence of the rivers Lem and Telling, we find the fortified town of Lembrow. A high stone wall with five stone turrets is a lot for a town of this size, but this close to the Blightwood, you can never be too secure.
            </p>
            <p>
            Where other towns might have small houses or farmsteads scattering the fields that surround the town centre, or even nestled up against the outer walls, Lembrow has nothing. Though the occasional crumbling ruin of a barn or farmhouse in the outskirts of the town is a reminder that this was not always the case.
            </p>
            <p>
            At dawn every day bells ring out from the South tower, which marks the beginning of another day for the townsfolk of Lembrow; another day survived on the border of the Blightwood. The guards open the gates, the blacksmith lights his forge, and of blue-robed figures emerge from a large stone building - the Sanitorium - and begin walking the streets, collecting tithes for the Church.
            </p>

            <p>
                The days of human sacrifice are over... How did you think it got its name?

            <h1>Lemford</h1>
            <h2>Picturesque Town Threatened by the Blight</h2>
            <p>
            With the gentle sloping fields of the Lower Lem Valley to each side, and the meandering Lem itself flowing slowly throught the town, for generations Lemford has been a quintessintially quiet and calm farming town.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, in recent years the peace has been disturbed by the latest snaking arm of the Blightwood, gradually spreading accross the farmland to the North. Hastily-constructed wooden fortifications are all the townsfolk have to defend themselves against the increasing number of blighted creatures.
            </p>
            <p>
            Despite its pastoral charm, Lemford's strategic importance should not be understated: not only is it a cruicial stopping point connecting Lembrow to the world beyond the Valley, it is also home to one of the Church's precious Refineries, a key source of Reversing Elixir for the Sanitorium at Lembrow.
