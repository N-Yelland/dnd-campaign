Prologue
========

A great sickness has come to these lands. Generations ago, the Empire saw the disease take root, eventually sucking the life out of the land and its people. As the Empire crumbled, the order it had brought to the land was lost; chaos and wilderness ruled once more. The country folk, who had learned to fear the plague in cities and towns, must now also fear the blighted woods and forests, and what lurks within.

The sickness is an awful one. It goes by many names to many people. To you, it is known as Silverblight. Many theories exist for its origin --- divine, arcane, natural, or born of something far older and stranger --- but what does it matter? Its touch is unmistakable. First, flesh pales to grey, then silver-white crystals bloom where once was blood and breath. Lastly, as Lady Death prepares to collect your Soul, there is a final twist: it corrupts the mind.

Brother is turned against sister; hound against master; flock against the shepherd. Under the weirding influence of the Blight, many forest creatures have become monstrous, daring, and crazed, preying on livestock and townsfolk alike, bringing the ruinous Blight into the heart of settlements, leaving death and despair in their wake.

However, within the darkness there are shining beacons of hope --- a select few individuals who possess a natural immunity to Silverblight, whom the townsfolk call “the Blessed”. Valiant Blessed Defenders are crucial to a town's survival. They can forage in blighted woodland, safely tend to the sick and dying, and fend off attacks from blighted monsters. Songs and sagas will be filled with the tales of heroism of the old Blessed, while they work to recruit and train the next generation to ensure civilisation's continued protection.

Blessed Mother Mariah Fairford is the last Blessed of Lembrow. For over two generations she has worked tirelessly to defend the townsfolk and the Valley of Lem beyond. But as she enters her twilight years, she seeks her successors. With only the company of her wagoner Ingram, she has been scouting the surrounding towns and villages for new Blessed recruits. That is how she met you...
