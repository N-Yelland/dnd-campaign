Building a Blessed Backstory
============================
 
.. note::

    "Blessed" is always pronounced with two syllables.

There are some questions to answer:

- How did you come to meet the Blessed Mother?
- How did you discover you were one of the Blessed?
- What is your experience with Silverblight?
- What did you do prior to meeting the Blessed Mother?

Some ideas:

- *I am the sole survivor of my village's most recent outbreak. Mariah came to help the village, but it was too late...*
- *My immunity was discovered in infancy; I have been raised to become a Blessed Defender ever since, trained in survival skills and martial combat. Mariah has finally assessed that I am ready.*
- *I have been studying the disease, to try and develop a cure, and Mariah's invitation represents an opportunity to get more first-hand information.*
- *Made a homeless orphan by the disease, I discovered my immunity by chance, and have been seeking the opportunity to put it to use. Mariah's invitation is exactly what I'm looking for.*
- *Having watched Blessed family members die defending our home, I hid my immunity, until something happened that changed my mind...*
- *I've journeyed far from my home to help the worst-affected settlements. Lembrow was top of my list, so I sought out Mariah when I arrived.*
- *Having spent most of my life caring for the sick to little effect, I want to do something I think actually makes a difference, even if it's outside of my comfort zone.*
- *I was reluctant to help at first, but I reconsidered once I considered the wealth of honours and gifts showered upon the Blessed Defenders...*
- *I wish to understand the origin of Silverblight, which means convincing a group to explore the Old Imperial ruins with me...!*
- *I believe my deity to have granted me the Blessing, and following Mariah is the natural path of devotion.*

Other things to consider:

- Do you already know any of the other members of the party?
- Had you heard of Mariah before? Perhaps you are from Lembrow itself.
- How does this fit into existing lore? (See the next section!)

Things to do:

- Come up with a personal memory concerning Silverblight.
- Come up with a story from your past that had a lasting impact.
