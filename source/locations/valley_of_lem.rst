    Nestled in the Valley of Lem, where the woodland gives way to grassland, near the confluence of the rivers Lem and Telling, we find the fortified town of Lembrow. A high stone wall with five stone turrets is a lot for a town of this size, but this close to the Blightwood, you can never be too secure.

    Where other towns might have small houses or farmsteads scattering the fields that surround the town centre, or even nestled up against the outer walls, Lembrow has nothing. Though the occasional crumbling ruin of a barn or farmhouse in the outskirts of the town is a reminder that this was not always the case.

    At dawn every day bells ring out from the South tower, which marks the beginning of another day for the townsfolk of Lembrow; another day survived on the border of the Blightwood. The guards open the gates, the blacksmith lights his forge, and of blue-robed figures emerge from a large stone building - the Sanitorium - and begin walking the streets, collecting tithes for the Church.

    During the Years of Darkness, a particularly extreme sect of the Order of Scarlet vehemently believed the Silverblight to be a punishment sent by the Old Gods, and that it could only be abated by inflicting greater punishment on ourselves. Hence the red stains on the steps that lead up to the raised central courtyard that give the temple its name today.

    Nowadays, the resident monks have a very different purpose: farming. Regular offerings to Orim and Onu, the Gods of the Earth and Sky, have ensured bountiful harvests year after year, and their blessings continue to ward off the encroaching Blightwood as nearby lands are taken by the disease.

    Many of the surrounding towns and villages have become dependent on the temple's reliable supply of healthy produce, and management of the temple's logisitics and commitments has become more complicated. Arguments between the high priests are not uncommon &mdash; their expertise does not generally extend to matters of commerce.

    With the gentle sloping fields of the Lower Lem Valley to each side, and the meandering Lem itself flowing slowly throught the town, for generations Lemford has been a quintessintially quiet and calm farming town.

    However, in recent years the peace has been disturbed by the latest snaking arm of the Blightwood, gradually spreading accross the farmland to the North. Hastily-constructed wooden fortifications are all the townsfolk have to defend themselves against the increasing number of blighted creatures.

    Despite its pastoral charm, Lemford's strategic importance should not be understated: not only is it a cruicial stopping point connecting Lembrow to the world beyond the Valley, it is also home to one of the Church's precious Refineries, a key source of Reversing Elixir for the Sanitorium at Lembrow.

    **Notable Locations:**

    * Lemford Refinery
    * The Laughing Crow Tavern
    * Temple to Orim

    **Notable Residents:**
    
    * Prudence Prassel, Mother Overseer of Lemford Refinery
    * Sister Tamela, assistant to Mother Prassel
    * Terence Hove, Mayor
    * Joam Stoddard, Blessed Defender of Lemford

    For generations the Gnomes of Worton have developed an expertise in local plants and herbs with medicinal and alchemical uses.

    The pungent ointments and salves created by the skilled village elders are thought to be a significant reason that the village has survived the encroaching Blightwood without a Blessed Defender to its name.

    Hidden away in the undegrowth, the Gnomish community of Nim's Hollow manages to thrive amidst the Blight. This is in no small part thanks to the Blessed family of Fallowgrove.

    The Fallowgroves are descendents of the legendary Gnomish druid, Grandfather Nim. His magic appears to flow through the family still, seemingly guaranteeing at least one Blessed child each generation. They continue to teach their children and community the arts of druidcraft, and work with Lembrow in protecting the valley.

    What is now a crumbling ruin, overtaken by the crawling vines and twisted trees of the Blightwood, was once the seat of the Grand Duchy of Lem. This was during the Years of Darkness, at a time before the Blight had spread to the Valley proper and was still held back by the Grimpeaks.

    It was during the period of the Duchy of Lem that the Old Watchtower was constructed. Designed to provide vision of the nearby Blightwood, it was used to gain early warning and observation of advancing bands of blighted creatures.

    Even when it was known the fight was lost, the people struggled until the end until Blight consumed them all, including the last Duke and Duchess themselves.

    **Notable Residents:**

    * Duke Garrus III, Protector of the Valley

    In the shadow of the imposing Mount Ereg can be found the graceful towers and pavillions of Tarras. In the time of the Old Empire, it was made rich by its proximity to the Bluestone quarries in the Grimpeaks and gemstone mines in the Erranite mountains.

    Following the Empire's fall, the city's remoteness made it an excellent home for a community of Tieflings ostracised from their previous homelands. This was not an uncommon occurence: the Tiefling speices possesses a considerably stronger resistance to the Blight, which was often connected in a negative light to their otherworldly appearance and the belief that the Blight is a punishment sent by the Gods.
