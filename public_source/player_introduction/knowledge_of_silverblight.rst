Knowledge of Silverblight
*************************

*This section documents what would generally be regarded as “common
knowledge” of Silverblight.*


Progression of the Disease
==========================

The onset of the disease is noticeable from the appearance of pale
blotches on the skin, developing into a grey pallor that covers the
entire body. In this initial stage, known as greying, with adequate
care and some magic, the disease is suppressible and barely
infectious. Common symptoms include tiredness and mild sunlight
sensitivity, but nothing major.

In the next stage, known as blooming, the blotches erupt into bright
silver-white crystals know as blightstones. The size and arrangement
of the crystals can vary considerably. They often cluster around the
point of infection, or are limited to one part of the body at first.
However, as the disease develops, they tend to increase in number and
spread. At this stage the tiredness worsens into acute fatigue, the
infected are often bedridden by this point.

The final stage of the disease is the turn, and, unlike the other
stages, it is purely mental in nature. In fact, it is often
accompanied by relief of the other physical symptoms. However, the
relief is only temporary, as what follows is certain death. The
infected individual undergoes an extreme personality change,
frequently becoming violent, delirious, or deeply melancholic. In the
beasts of the wilderness, this has caused unprecedented aggression,
leading to attacks on settlements that bring about destruction and
infection in equal measure.

The time taken for the disease to progress is highly variable, and
little is understood as to why. The infected can remain in the greying
stage for a few days to a few months, and the blooming stage can last
longer again still. In fact, a few individuals remain in the blooming
stage for years, with little to no physical symptoms beyond the
crystalline growths. Thought to be partially immune to the disease,
they are hence called the half-Blessed.


Blightstones
============

While they remain attached to the living body of an infected person or
creature, the blightstones are nearly indestructible, at least as hard
as steel and as sharp as a knife’s edge. They remain firmly part of
the body - not removable without significant harm. For some of the
afflicted they can serve as excellent natural armour and weaponry.

However, after death of the afflicted, the crystals loosen and, while
still sharp, they become incredibly brittle - shattering into a cloud
of fine shards after any sudden impact. Being cut or scratched by the
crystals, or inhaling their dust form, almost always leads to an
infection in humans and animals alike. Moreover, infections in this
way progress rapidly: the skin around the infection site can start
greying in minutes.
