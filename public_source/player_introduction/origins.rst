Lore & Your Origins
*******************

Note: In 5.5e, your character’s starting abilities and proficiencies are
   determined by a combination of class, species, and background. This
   section is intended to show how different species and backgrounds
   might manifest within this setting.None of this is meant to be
   particularly proscriptive, and there are plenty of gaps where you
   should feel free to make more stuff up! In particular, treat no
   list as exhaustive!

You were born sometime in the first few centuries of the Years of
Longing (YL), an age of fragile peace in Erran following the wars and
desolation of the Years of Darkness that came before. Silverblight
still ravages the land, but there is just enough fight and
determination in the people to bring hope of a future for
civilisation.


Religion & Governance
=====================

Your “recruiter”, Mariah Fairford, is the Mother Overseer of the
Lembrow Sanatorium, an establishment of the **Church of Brightwater**.
This is a major religious order originating in Brightwater during the
Years of Darkness, and now spread throughout Erran. They worship the
**Blessed Saints**, once mortal Blessed individuals who, generations
ago, sacrificed themselves heroically in the enduring fight against
the Blight. Their ascent to divine status is made possible by the
focussed worship of the Church.

*Perhaps you were a devotee of the church. Where did you work? What
made you leave your position?*

*  **Attendants** work in sanatoria to care for afflicted patients.
   While rarely can they cure the disease, they can at least ease
   one’s suffering… [Acolyte]

*  **Alchemicals** work in refineries, and learn the advanced
   techniques to produce reversing elixir, the only known cure to
   Silverblight. [Artisan, Sage, Scribe]

*  **Itinerants** work between the two, and collect the all-important
   alms and charity to allow the Church’s vital work to continue.
   [Soldier, Guide]

The other major religious organisation is the monastic **Order of
Scarlet**. They believe the Blight to be a punishment from the Gods,
and as such attempt to appease them in prayer, repentance, and even
sacrifice. Compared to the Church of Brightwater, they are more
dispersed and less structured, with each temple operating in
isolation, both from each other and wider society.

*Perhaps you were once an acolyte of one of these temples. What drew
you out of seclusion? Exactly what you did will depend on the God you
worshipped…*

*  **Ithikku** and **Akkamon** are the twin Gods of Chaos and Order.
   Their blessings grant power and might, that might turn priests into
   battle-monks, ready to fight off whatever the Blight sends.
   [Soldier, Hermit]

*  **Onu** is the God of the Sky, **Orim** is God of the Earth. Wards
   and blessings of Onu ensure good rains for crops and a bountiful
   harvest. Surplus crops from such consecrated farmland are a
   lifeline for nearby towns and villages with farms decimated by the
   plague. [Farmer, Hermit]

*  **Ghelothar** is the God of the Mountains… **Varothar** is God of
   the Sea.

Beyond religious groups, the closest thing to “government” in the
Years of Longing is the **Klathrassian Bureaucracy**. Headquartered in
the imposing Grand Sanctum of the city of **Klathras**, their original
purpose was to ensure that the city remains Blight-free through
meticulous surveys of populations and diligent record keeping. In
recent years their scope has expanded to analysis of Silverblight
throughout most of Erran.

The Bureaucracy also administrate the search for relics of the Old
Empire, and carefully document the findings, in the hope that someone
unearthed from the past that might help in the fight against Blight in
the future.

*Perhaps you were once employed by the Bureaucracy, either directly or
indirectly. In which department did you work? Did you abandon your
station? Why?*

*  The Department of Catalogues and Indices keep records of everything
   they can (there’s even a catalogue for catalogues!). [Scribe, Sage]

*  The Department of Observations and Expeditions works with various
   parties to survey nearby land and maintain relationships with more
   distant peoples. [Guide, Guard, Merchant, Sailor]

While there are no hereditary titles, senior bureaucrats in the
**Department of Internal Logistics** are well-remunerated for their
coin-counting competence; they and their families are the closest that
Klathras has to nobility [Noble]. The relative wealth that the
bureaucracy brings the city mean it is a much-beloved hub for the
creative arts, in a world where most have little time for such
frivolities [Artisan, Entertainer]. It can be equally appealing for
those looking to take advantage [Charlatan, Criminal].

Outside of large cities, day-to-day governance for villages and towns
comes from local rulers: elected Chiefs and Mayors and unelected Lords
and Ladies whose children inherit their titles [Noble]. The
temperament and regimes of these leaders can vary greatly, but
generally they should provide some form of protection from
Silverblight if they expect to hold their power for any length of time
[Guard, Soldier].


Education & Magic
=================

Graduates of the **Aldovian Academy**, Klathras, are highly sought out
to offer such protection. Dedicated to training the next generation of
Blessed Defenders in the skills necessary to fend of Blighted
creatures, and handle the effects of their attacks, the Academy
accepts only children proven to be Blessed.

*Perhaps you were a student or teacher at the Academy. What did you
teach, or what was your favourite subject? The Academy is divided into
four schools…*

*  **School of the Physical Arts**: close/ranged combat, strength and
   conditioning. [Soldier, Guard]

*  **School of Healing and Restorative Magic**: herbalism, medicine,
   and restorative magic. [Sage, Acolyte?]

*  **School of Wilderness Survival**: natural history, foraging,
   geography and cartography. [Sage, Guide, Scribe]

There’s also the **School of Blight Sciences**, but it only teaches a
single subject, only to students in their final year, which culminates
an “exam” in which students are deposited in the Blightwood and
assessed on their ability to fend for themselves.

Other educational establishments include the **University of Port
Rallian** and the library of **Lightwarden Abbey**, Brightwater. Far
from their intellectual height under the Old Empire, they now focus
their limited resources on researching Silverblight and the history of
the Empire it defeated. [Sage, Scribe, Guide]

While most knowledge of Magic was lost with the Old Empire, one
institution of magical education remains: the secretive **Drayford
College**. Outside its walls, any magical knowledge must have been
self-taught, possibly obtained from studying old arcane inscriptions,
or come from some innate or otherworldly ability.

Despite the best efforts of the Church and the Bureaucracy, for many,
death by blight remains inevitable, and outbreaks are far too likely.
It is not uncommon for whole families or villages to find themselves
reduced to nothing in a matter of weeks, perhaps only the Blessed
surviving [Hermit, Wayfarer].

However, for some unlucky souls Death never comes (or at least, not
before she is due). While they bear the crystalline scars and terribly
pallor, they lack many of the symptoms and do not progress to the
final stage: delirium. Such people are called **half-Blessed**, though
really it is more of a curse: while they themselves may be unaffected,
they still have the ability to infect others. This often leads to
their ostracism from society. Could this be you?


Elves & Dwarves
===============

The **Elves**, with their luxuriant lifespans and affinity with
nature, consider themselves to be more susceptible to Silverblight
than other species: they are much less open to the rest of Erran now
than during the reign of the Old Empire, who were a close ally.
Fortunately, the sylvan groves they call home are across the continent
from the spreading blight.

Despite this, the Elvish Lords [Noble] continue to send Blessed Elves
to the border regions of their lands as “Guardians” to “fend off” any
Blighted onslaught [Soldier, Guard]. Though it is not unheard of for
Elven Guardians to take pity on the suffering land they see before
them, and leave their posts, to seek out more meaningful opportunities
[Hermit].

**Dwarves’** natural hardiness seems to make them more resilient to
the Blight, and means there is a greater proportion of Blessed among
them. In many ways their lives are unchanged from during the Years of
Darkness and before, able to produce works of art, culture, and
craftsmanship [Artisan, Merchant, Entertainer].

However, Dwarves are similarly reluctant to associate with humans.
Many attribute this to mistreatment at the hands of the Old Empire,
which was only a few generations ago in the lives of Dwarves. They are
slow to forgive past transgressions, and while it would be unfair (to
most) to say that they are grateful for the arrival of Silverblight,
they do not wish to see a return to the old ways. Despite this, there
are some who are willing to look past historic wrongs and take up arms
together, against the Blight.


Halflings & Gnomes
==================

The homeland of the **Halflings** was overcome by the blight not long
after the Old Empire had fallen. Few in number, those that remain
exist as refugees or nomads, seeking to a return to a stable way of
life. [Hermit, Wayfarer, Criminal]

**Gnomes** are pervasive and persistent, existing often unseen, with
their small, tightly knit communities able to slip through the cracks.
That’s not to say that they haven’t been affected by the blight, but
their ingenuity has allowed them to remain in lands long abandoned by
other folk. [Guide, Hermit]


Exotic Species
==============

**Dragonborn** and **Tieflings** are not native to these lands. But at
the zenith of the Old Empire’s expanse, trade and diplomacy with all
these races was commonplace, and families of these folk settled in the
port towns and cities [Merchant, Sailor, Artisan]. When the blight
came, many will have returned to their homeland while they still
could; later ships would be sent back, or worse scuttled fearing the
spread of the disease. Thus, a few will remain, perhaps dreaming of
their homeland. Occasionally, newcomers arrive, though why they choose
this blighted land is known only to themselves! - The home of the
Dragonborn is the rocky, sun-soaked archipelago of **Ajrazan**. - The
home of the Tieflings is the storm-ridden **Isle of Torment**.

**Goliaths** come from the Northern Wastes, and **Aasimar** from a
mysterious continent in the south (where?). Both are exceptionally
rare in Erran.

*That’s not to say you couldn’t be one… but then, why are you here?*
