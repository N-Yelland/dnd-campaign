The History of Erran
********************


The Erranite Empire - Rise & Fall
=================================

While life almost anywhere in Erran today is shaped by the Blight
above all else, this was not always the case. From the moment of its
creation, the world was wild and untamed, and Erran was no exception.
Small, isolated communities were locked in a constant battle for
survival against the terrible beasts of the endless wilderness.
However, the balance would forever change when a community of humans
emerged in the North-East of Erran (near what would later become the
Imperial capital, Vilras) with the ability to control and shape the
powerful magic that flows through the world.

Over many generations this small tribe of humans would expand into a
continent-spanning empire - the Erranite Empire - stretching from the
Westernmost peak of the Erranite mountains to the borders of the Elven
groves in the East. As the Empire grew, so did the people’s knowledge
of magic. It was this knowledge that enabled their dominion over
Erran. With magically augmented weaponry and healing, and the ability
to bend nature to their will, they could bring order and civilisation
to previously untameable lands, uniting the isolated peoples and
defeating the tyrannical monsters that opposed them.

At the Empire’s peak, magic was ingrained in every stratum of society.
The nobility and elites would think nothing of teleporting to a
distant city for an afternoon, or summoning elemental servants to tend
to their gardens and estates. Even the poorest farmers would likely
use enchanted oxen-less ploughs for tilling the fields, and light
their houses with oil-less lamps that burned with a bright arcane
fire. Trade flourished, for the enchanted Erranite ships could cross
seas that would take ordinary vessels weeks in a matter of days; this
extended the Empire’s influence further, through colonies and vassal
city states on the distant shores of Ajrazan and elsewhere. Their
arcane superiority was even reflected in their buildings and monuments
- vast structures that would have been near impossible to build with
physical labour alone, etched with runic carvings - often warding
spells to ensure stability and survival.

But it was not to last. Nearly two thousand years into the Old
Imperial Calendar, during the reign of Empress Volathrosi III, there
emerged a deadly foe that they could not simply vanquish with magic:
Silverblight. Though it seemingly came from nothing, the blight is
drawn to magic like a moth to a flame: by this measure the Imperial
Cities must have outshone the sun. It will be no surprise that the
first outbreaks were in the major cities of Vilras and Ranakhan, but
it quickly spread across the continent like wildfire. Its ease of
transmission and ability to infect all creatures, including plants and
animals, already made it a dangerous force, but its arcane inertness
made it a truly unstoppable force. In a matter of months, the Grand
Imperial Cities were deserted; the Erranite Empire was no more.


The Years of Darkness
=====================

The account hitherto is a summary of knowledge extracted from the
occasional surviving text or inscription from Imperial Ruins. The
events of the years that followed are worse documented still - for
this reason they are known as the Years of Darkness. One must imagine
the considerable death toll in cities leading to a rapid collapse of
society’s basic functions, and great unrest among the survivors. In
the cities, if you were fortunate enough to avoid the plague, you
might yet see your end in a fight over the last rations of food, or
simply succumb to starvation. In the countryside, unabated by the
Empire’s now absent might, the chaotic wilderness could slowly reclaim
the land. Evil beasts once consigned to artistic depictions and
history roamed the land once more.

With the loss of the Empire, so too was lost an unimaginable wealth of
arcane knowledge. What little scraps of knowledge remained became
interwoven into ritual and worship, not something to be comprehended
by mortal minds, and so logically a product of the gods.

The runic wards carved into the walls of the Old Imperial cities
remained active long after their creators’ demise. Thus, many
structures of the Old Empire stand almost unchanged since their
construction, evading ruin and disrepair. But this has not stopped the
rewilding of their surroundings. Ever since the Fall of the Empire,
the Great Blightwood has grown outward from the ancient cities to
cover much of the Eastern portion of the continent, always threatening
to encroach further still.

What the few surviving records from this period tell us is that
throughout the Years of Darkness, civilisation made various attempts
to rekindle its flame, with limited success. The most promising was
likely the Murnish Kingdom, which provided a lasting safe haven from
the Blight for well over 100 years before a combination of famine and
civil war brought about its end. But no attempt would have been
remotely possible were it not for the Blessed.


The Years of Longing
====================

Approximately 500 years ago, civilisation landed its first punch in
the fight against Silverblight, when the people discovered a cure. A
ruin-seeker (and later Blessed Saint) by the name of Mariah recovered
a crumbling scroll that hinted at a methodology for creating a cure
for Silverblight.

After years of further expeditions and experimentation, a group of
sisters of the Church of Brightwater manufactured the first vial of
Reversing Elixir, which when administered to the blighted, would
remove any sign of the disease in only a few days.

The process was (and still is) very expensive, deeply technical, and
prone to failure. But today, specially trained servants of the Church
work diligently in a handful of specialised Refineries across Erran to
produce as much of the stuff as possible.

More powerful than the elixir’s effect on the individual was its
effect on society. It represented a bright glimmer of hope where there
had only been desperation and darkness. With hope, people were able to
dream of a better future, and long for what good may to come. Thus,
the Years of Longing began, with the year of St. Mariah’s momentous
discovery as zero.

The advent of the Elixir marked a shift in the balance of power
between the Blight and the living, maybe even a step in the
eradication of Blight for good. Though not everyone is so optimistic,
and the blighted monstrosities of the woods still pose an existential
threat to many communities. The dominance of Blight in the land ebbs
and flows from year to year, but every year the twisted Blightwood
seems to draw closer to the boundary of “civilisation”.
