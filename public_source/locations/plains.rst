Brightwater
===========

Holy City of the Blessed Saints

On a peaceful night, the shining lights in the marble towers of the
City of Brightwater are reflected perfectly in the serene waters of
Lake Vossar, echoing the stars of the heavens above. Home of the
eponymous Church of Brightwater, the skyline is dominated by the
towering white and blue facades of Lightwarden Abbey standing proud on
St. Septa’s Island, accessible only via the Bridge of The Saints.

Lightwarden abbey includes many of city’s important locations. Its
huge sanatorium is the largest there is; the sick may journey many
miles to be treated here, despite the volume of patients it takes in,
it offers one of the best Silverblight survival rates too. This is
likely because of the vast refinery complex right next door. In
addition to producing a steady flow of reversing elixir, the Mothers
Overseer at the Abbey’s refinery spend their time educating the next
generation of Sisters Alchemical.

The Abbey’s library is an eminent educational establishment in its own
right; it is home to the world’s largest collection of texts and
records from the Old Empire. The Great Chapel holds daily rites and
ceremonies, often conducted by the Church’s Mother Superior. This
includes the annual Church Congress, where the Mothers Overseer from
across Erran come to discuss the Church’s future goals and challenges.

Much of the rest of the city has grown up in support of the Abbey. The
shops and stalls of the city offers the finest money can buy when it
comes to candles, incense, and other religious paraphernalia.

Klathras
========

Vibrant city hidden behind ancient temple walls

Where the gorge carved by the River Fairen breaks through into the Bay
of Tears, several tall islands erupt from the waves with steep, jagged
cliffs on all sides. Atop the largest of these islands sits the
crumbling ruins of the Ancient temple complex of Klathras, some parts
of which predate even Erranite rule.

Following its abandonment after the fall of the Empire, it has grown
into the most populous settlement in Erran. Now the citizens inhabit
all the old temple buildings. Some rise above the city in squat blocky
towers, others are carved into the rock itself with windows built into
the cliff face itself.

To ensure the populations survival, a strict quarantine policy is
maintained. While this is made easier by the city’s inaccessible
location, it is also administered by the Klathrassian Bureaucracy, the
closest these lands come to organised government. The Bureaucracy is
based in the imposing Grand Sanctum, whose impenetrable inner halls
are only accessible by the senior bureaucrats.

A smaller adjacent island is home to the Aldovian Academy, which takes
in young Blessed children from across Erran as students, to be trained
in all the essential skills for Blessed defenders: combat, medicine,
alchemy, etc.

With Silverblight only a concern of distant lands, the citizens are
free to revel in more frivolous pursuits. Klathras has become a hub
for the arts, both creative and performative.
